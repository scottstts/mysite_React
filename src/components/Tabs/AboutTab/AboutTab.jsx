            __html: `I believe that all problems are eventually solvable through technology without introducing any additional externality. Technology evolves‚Äîgradually or rapidly‚Äîto match the complexity of problems. Today's flawed solutions will never capture how easily these problems may be resolved in the future.<br /><br />

            Technology emerges from the interactions between intelligent entities and the universe they inhabit, while intelligence improves and evolves through technology. Technology is not only an external manifestation of intelligence but it stands as the ultimate culmination.<br /><br />

            Intelligence is the meta-problem underlying all challenges. Once intelligence is solved, we indirectly unlock solutions to every problem. The acceleration of ASI injects a second-order surge into all frontier sciences and engineering, placing us at an inflection point where the future will be unrecognizably better.<br /><br />

            The exponential growth of compute power, digital data & artifacts, and nn-based AI signals a broad intelligence revolution in both scale and depth.<br /><br />

            Technology has also been historically proven to be the only robust, consistent, and effective means to combat various social disparities, both directly and indirectly.<br /><br />

            Acceleration follows an exponential curve while human imagination remains confined to linear velocity. A fundamental transformation may be daunting, yet it is equally if not more exhilarating, for the only way forward is <span class="eater-regular text-xl">into the unknown</span> <i class="fa-solid fa-ghost"></i>.`

          <p className="text-white leading-relaxed text-left">Intelligence is the scaffold upon which we build the future of business and society. When intelligence can be artificially created and arbitrarily duplicated, this scaffold gains the capacity to extend beyond imagination. <span className="font-bold text-yellow-200">My role is to be a builder on this scaffold ‚Äì crafting useful tools that fundamentally reconstruct how we think about tech business logic, product-market fit, operational excellence, and resource allocation.</span> I want to reimagine these foundational elements in light of our new technological capabilities. I want to be a part of this profound intelligence revolution in how we create and capture value. <span className="font-bold text-yellow-200">The techno-capital engine is leading the charge, and I am an agent of change.</span> The impact will not be immediate, but it will be impossible to ignore.</p>
