    description: `<span class="font-semibold text-yellow-200">I would pick flawed authenticity over faked perfection any day.</span><br><br>

To borrow the ending of the <span class="font-semibold italic">Elon Musk</span> biography by Walter Isaacson, "<span class="italic">They can be reckless, cringeworthy, sometimes even toxic. They can also be crazy. Crazy enough to think they can change the world.</span>"<br><br>

Elon is pure, an extremely rare trait these days, especially in public figures. He always says what he means and means what he says. This is why he is always surrounded by controversies. But even among these controversies, you should never ignore the fact that he has advanced frontier exploration of modern time more than any single individual in history. In fact, this is my <span class="font-semibold text-yellow-100">litmus test</span> for peopleâ€“you can disagree with his opinions all you want, sometimes I disagree with them as well. But if you would go as far as writing off all his achievements simply because you don't like what he says, I know we are not the same people.<br><br>

His brilliance, hard work, determination, execution, honesty, and good heart are among some of the things I constantly look up to.<br><br>`,

    description: `<span class="font-semibold text-yellow-200">The only limitation is your imagination and execution.</span><br><br>

From a dishwasher to Founder/CEO of the biggest and most influential company in the world today, how can you not find Jensen Huang inspiring?<br><br>

He always goes to first principles when faced with extraordinarily complex problems. This is what makes him such a visionary and problem solver. He works constantly, learns constantly, and inspires people constantly. He perceives a goal, sets a course, and pursues it persistently on the order of decades. Nvidia's success is not a fluke, it is a group of brilliant people guided by a wise and persistent leader to position around the apple tree so they would be the closest to pick them up when the apples fall.<br><br>

Jensen tells the story with his own life that you can just do things.<br><br>`,

    description: `<span class="font-semibold text-yellow-200">Imagine the wisest philosopher you've read, now look at Naval's tweets.</span><br><br>

My life was not the same after I was introduced with <span class="font-semibold italic">The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</span>. Life is a willful journey. If you go through your life just doing things without giving them much thought, you are just a group of molecules drifting where the universe takes you.<br><br>

Of all the wisdom from Naval on wealth, health, and happiness, what I get from him the most is self reflection and the urge to listen to my heart. The key is to be unapologetically proactive on who you really are.<br><br>`,

    name: 'Andrej Karpathy',
    description: `<span class="font-semibold text-yellow-200">You don't just get called "AI mentor for an entire generation", you have to have earned it.</span><br><br>

Andrej Karpathy's tutorials on neural networks and Transformer are one of the major reasons why I've become so obsessed with AI, and certainly the biggest reason why I was able to advance from surface impressions to deeper technical understanding as an absolute beginner. I also know for a fact that this goes for most new AI enthusiasts like me in the past few years. And before that, his class CS231n at Stanford was a source of inspiration and knowledge for many computer vision talents.<br><br>

I am glad Andrej decided to go all in on democratizing AI education after his journey at OpenAI and Tesla, which God knows people now and in the future desperately need. He is a phenomenal educator and just one of the most brilliant minds out there.<br><br>`,

    name: 'Pieter Levels',
    description: `<span class="font-semibold text-yellow-200">Digital nomad is a statement of freedom, honesty, and getting shit done.</span><br><br>

Funny enough, before Levels went on the Lex Pod, I'd never heard of him or the concept of digital nomad, now I find myself often contemplating the beauty of this way of life.<br><br>

He is a rebel against the status quo. He is a rebel against institutionalization and bureaucracy. And he is also a rebel against the confinement of creativity and productivity. Everything you need to build today can fit into a backpack. Your ideas have infinite potentials, you have infinite potentials.<br><br>

Pieter Levels represents a generation of indie hackers who feel disconnected to the world and rediscover peace, meaning, and success in a completely different spectrum of life, simply from building and sharing.<br><br>

There is a profound wisdom from him and his philosophy that I find extremely enchanting. Your life doesn't have to be just another fulfilment of the standard template. If you want something else, make it happen.<br><br>`,
