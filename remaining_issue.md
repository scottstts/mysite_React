# Here are the remaining issues that the React project needs to fix to be a perfect clone of the original site

* body text seems a little thin compared to the original, investigate the original to match
* The one click to top button is in the wrong position, should be at the botton right, reference the original site code
* bg image not showing, only the animation effect, reference the original, the bg image is in the static_assets, and should be vaguely visial combined with the translucent effect and animations
* Learning journey tab every card title, the date and the main title should be rendering in separate lines, reference the orginal site for this
* slider direction issue. when click right at the last image, the slider should still swipe left to the first image; same when click left at first image, the slider should swipe right to the final image. in other words, the slide direction should be consistent
* For all card text bodies, the original text had paragraph new lines, and the emojis used were fontAwesome emojis, reference the original text bodies to make them identical
* The effect of hover card and card shift up and zoom in a little is not there, note this effect should be applied to all content in cards except for images (single ones and in sliders) and embedded videos
* images in Inspiration tab cards are not at full width. They should be roughly the same width (with margin) as the card and rendered full. Now they are just a centered little window under text
